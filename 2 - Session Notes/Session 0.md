###### Raw notes
Moonwave harbor, afternoon in the market, it's bustling. Stalls, fresh sea breeze, exotic fruits, gems in casings, lots of merchants eager to sell, mostly humans, smattering of other races. Adalheid's shop (blue roof, rectangle) is just south of Ventina's shoe emporium (small blue roof, west side), and Bea's secondhand stall is set up just across from that. Gorm is looking around for food items to buy and prepare, and Vas follows a bit behind. Oliver Bolderdown comes walking down the street, pretty disheveled, greets Bea but goes a bit further south and hammers something to the board, a piece of paper. Bea comes up to greet him, asks what he's doing.

Urgent assistance required to protect my crops from nightly pest attacks. These pests are unusually aggressive and have been causing significant damage to my fields. I need capable adventurers to help identify and fend off these threats.

He's about the same age as Bea, he complains about the pests, her repellant recipe hasn't been of any help. Everyone gathers, says they'll help. his field is a bit smaller each new morning. After we all say we'll help, he gives us directions and says to meet around dusk. Gorm borrows a cookpot from Bea to cook up some of the octopus he purchased, to make some healthy snacks before heading out. Vas gives some blessings to sailors that are getting ready to head out, they offer a few coppers in return, feeling much more confident for his blessings. Adalheid closes up the shop, and her manager notices that she's eager to get moving and so encourages her to head out a bit early. Bea closes the sign on her shop, and Ventina's mother basically kicks her out because she's so excited. Gorm shares one of his treats with Vas, he made boiled octopus fritters.

Closer to nightfall, as we approach Oliver's farm, we can see Oliver tending to a few nibbled pieces of food. Gorm offers a bit of octopus to the cat he sees, and Felix (the cat) grabs the octopus and runs off into the bushes. Oliver hasn't seen the pests, but it sounds like somethings ripping things out of the ground and running away with it. He takes us to a back field, and is confident that this is where they'll take from next. He also shows us the front farm that they've basically emptied. Gorm can tell that something took the food, but no tracks. Adalheid looks too, can't detect anything magical-seeming, but she does spot near the wall a set of tiny paw prints. It's at least one small creature. It's not a wild creature, but maybe a small cat.

At the back field, Vas looks around for any creatues. He sees Felix on the roof, but nothing else. Bea does notice Felix jump to the other side of the house. Out of the corner of her eye, Ventina notices another cat sneak out from the bushes, quietly sneaking into the tomatoes, and the another cat sneaking out from the trees, and a third on the roof, it's not Felix (who starts knocking the milk cans around). Quickly, there are dozens of cats on the farm, taking all the food. Gorm goes to shoo a cat away from the tomatoes using his whip cracking. All of the cats look at him, freezing for a bit with food in their mouths, not eating it just grabbing it, and then go back to what they're doing. Vas cats Thaumaturgy to try to scare them away, with a crack of thunder and a booming voice "shoo!" Felix is watching, then lets out a screeching meow, before all the cats run into the woods in a single direction. Felix, with a loaf of bread in his mouth, runs that way too. 

We follow them, deeper and deeper into the woods. Near a lake 25-30 minutes from the farmouse, we see the cats run into this general area. There are piles of neatly-organized food here. A bit further in, we see Felix, who looks at us and then runs a bit further down. A bit further, and we see a campsite. He disappears, and then a woman in moss-green clothes appears, holding a rattled old staff, face covered. Ventina says that we're here to investigate what's happening to the food, and the woman says the food belongs to us now. Vas challenges this, and she insists. "It belongs to the circle.” The circle is not for the likes of us to know, and then she bangs her staff to the ground three times. 4 little grass twig blights appear out of the ground. "I will ask you for the last time, leave now. This food is ours, we only take what we need." Bea says she understands, and everyone deserves to eat, but this food is coming out of the mouths of kids. At the mention of Oliver's name, she spits on the ground, says he stole the land, and the twigs attack.

The druid goes to hit Ventina, Adalheid retaliates, and hostilities begin. After some back and forths, including Bea handing a heavy hit on the druid and Vas Thunderwaving two blights, the druid starts to flee. We chase her down, though, and take out the druid, with Adalheid knocking her unconscious.

The last blight turns into a small shrub. Ventina goes to tie up the unconscious druid. Gorm notices that the food is from local farms, it's a lot of food, more than one person could eat, and at least 10-15 people. Vas heals Bea a little bit, and Bea thinks about the history of the land, because of the druid's talk about invaders and land thieves. She has heard stories that the humans came to this area specifically to look for resources, but they weren't the first. There are ancient organizations that lived within the forest. At least one temple in the area long ago. There was a druid circle here long ago, but they're gone. She knows that there were skirmishes between the human settlers and the druids, but there are no records of it. Gorm thinks about how the druid may have been transporting the food. Doesn't see anything, but maybe small boats, based on some tracking on the muddy ground; The stream connects out to the main bay. We think that we should question the druid more. End session

Tl;dr: The party gets together to defend Oliver's crops, follows some cats, knocks out the druid commanding them.
