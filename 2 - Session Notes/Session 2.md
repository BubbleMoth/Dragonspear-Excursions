# Player Notes

Gorm attunes to the staff over our rest in the area and asks Bea to inspect the ==inedible mushrooms== to see if she knows what they are. Unfortunately, she isn't able to figure out anything about them.

We know that Meepo would be over where he took care of Calsyrex (she/her), but for now, Adalheid asks some of the kobolds with weapons what we might expect regarding traps and goblin tactics. They don't go out without Rahg, as goblin raiders are dangerous. They've set up some traps on the doors to be aware of goblins coming, and some pitfall traps too. We learn that the dragon was kept in the cage. She was angry about it, apparently.

Bea turns to Gorm to ask if wyrmlings are sentient/self-aware, or more like dogs and cats. He says that a wyrmling is like a child; self-aware, petulant, curious—you wouldn't keep one in a cage. We remember Yusdrayel saying that she's a white dragon wyrmling, and it strikes Gorm as odd that a white dragon wyrmling would be in this region rather than somewhere colder. Another kobold approaches and says that it's not every day you get to study a dragon in captivity. Yusdrayl brought it after acquiring it somehow. There's a lot you can learn from dragons. Bea asks what they wanted to learn, but it doesn't really seem to know much.

Going into Meepo's room, we see broken furniture and splotches of dried blood, smell burnt meat, and see evidence of a campfire. There's a cage in the middle, with some toys and a bedroll nearby. There is whimpering coming from the bedroll. Bea asks, "Meepo, is that you?" Meepo whimpers, "Please, please don't hurt me, it's not my fault that the dragon is gone." We promise we're here to help the dragon, and he comes out. Meepo's skin is covered in scars as he emerges. Gorm says we're here to find the dragon, but we worry that the dragon won't know us as allies, and want to know what it likes. Meepo tells us that she likes to eat and do dragon things. She has been asking for gold and just started blowing frost recently. She seems angry all the time. Bea asks if that's how Meepo got a lot of the scars. He responds that that's how dragons show affection. Looking at him, Meepo doesn't really seem to understand how bad some of his ideas are. It's likely that the dragon told Meepo that it hated him and wanted to eat him, but Meepo probably just accepted this as it being a rebellious teenager.

"What did the goblins do exactly?" we ask. He responds that "they came, killed the guards, we didn't have enough for some reason, and they had a key to the dragon's cage. Only Meepo, Rahg, and Yusdrayl have keys to the cage." Meepo still has his key, pulled out from under his tunic. Gorm asks how they took the dragon; it fought back and killed some of them, but they dragged it away with a rope around its neck. Meepo is confused by Ventina saying that she wouldn't want a dragon, like saying you wouldn't want a free car. Meepo says he'd be thankful if we could rescue the dragon, as would Yusdrayl, and even Rahg (who's scary and yells a lot). Rahg likes to yell at everyone, hates Meepo and possibly Yusdrayl—not a nice guy. Meepo calls him evil. We do know that Rahg has been keeping an eye on us. He's not listening right now, but we've noticed it. Gorm asks if Meepo needs his key right now. He looks at the cage but says maybe he doesn't need it right now. Gorm says we'd want to compare it with the other keys to make sure they match. Gorm thanks him for the key in Draconic, and Meepo's eyes light up and he starts talking quickly in Draconic.

We find Rahg nearby and Vas mentions that we learned that the goblins had a key somehow. He asks if Rahg has his key on him. Rahg's tight-lipped smile widens, and he steps around the corner. "You all seem to know how to take care of yourselves. I and those I trust are looking to make big changes around here. If you want to know more, follow me..." and steps away. We follow, with Bea and Adalheid wary, keeping an eye out for traps and weird movements by Rahg. Gorm keeps focus on Rahg to make sure that he doesn't do anything suspicious. He stops in a dusty room with scattered stony debris and rubble, with an ornate fountain built into the eastern wall, with a carving of a diving dragon on it. "Let's not waste each other's time here. Yusdrayl is running us into the ground. Didn't it seem weird to you to keep a dragon as a pet? They're sentient creatures; they can talk. And then she loses it? And she's losing this war? Dragons deserve respect; they deserve to be worshipped." "That doesn't tell us if you still have your key," says Bea. Rahg only responds that "Yusdrayl needs to go. The order here needs new leadership." Vas asks how giving the goblins the key benefits him. Rahg says that it unites the people and shows that Yusdrayl is weak. Calsyrex can take care of himself and kill the goblins. Adalheid and Vas can tell that he's probably going to want to resolve the problem with Yusdrayl with violence. Vas asks, if he succeeds, what his end goal is: to be in charge? What makes him better than Yusdrayl? Rahg says that he can handle his own, that Yusdrayl isn't the strong leader that they need. Adalheid asks why give the goblins Calsyrex if he wants to defeat them, and he's confident that Calsyrex will kill half of the goblins and not aid them. Thinking on his behavior, we do know that some kobolds are compelled to serve dragons. The situation, with survival and natural power balances, makes sense to Gorm.

Vas asks what Rahg intends as his next move. The dragon has been stolen, people are upset, we've been sent to retrieve the dragon and have our own problems with the goblins. Rahg says he'd move against Yusdrayl; he's confident because he's captain of the guard. Most are weak but he and his have swords. If the weak folk don't want that? Then they won't have a place in the tribe, but there are more that agree with him than we realize. Gorm states that we don't have much skin in the game; we're just here for the dragon and our own business. Rahg says it'd be nice if we help. Gorm asks why we should. Rahg offers the same treasure that Yusdrayl had, and Gorm says that's not necessarily compelling. Disappointed by our lack of interest, he starts to step out. Adalheid has the idea of what if they both lead, but the rest of the party wants to stay out of the struggle for power, though, and we all agree that nobody should have/enslave a dragon. Adalheid doesn't know much about dragons, but knows that people do say that chromatic dragons are evil and metallic dragons are good, but that seems like a very black-and-white view, more for children than reality maybe.

We decide to tell Meepo to find somewhere safe to hide since it's probably going to be chaotic and dangerous for a bit, as well as to let other non-fighters know about that potential danger. We also want to ask him where to find the goblins. Returning to his area, he asks, "Did you all find her?" Vas asks for general directions. Meepo says there's lots of stuff here, as he takes us around the corner and points to the north door with the guards. The goblins came from the east when they attacked, and that's where they took her. There's lots of cool stuff to the southeast, but he's never seen goblins come from that way (just kobolds), and it leads to the surface. Adalheid warns him about potential chaos and danger from the goblins, and Vas expands that it may not just be from goblins since tempers are running high. Meepo asks if he should tell Yusdrayl. Adalheid assures him that Yusdrayl is aware of potential dangers, so no need. Gorm further explains it in Draconic. Meepo asks to get Calsyrex back and then grabs his bedroll and hides in the corner.

We decide to quickly tell Kon the same and ask about Urky as well. Kon is in the common area where we rested. Gorm is going to start a fire over on the other side of the room and starts to show the kobolds how to cook safely using salts and smoke. Adalheid asks how we might recognize Urky (having held Kon behind); he apparently has gnomish features and is the only gnome in the area. We warn Kon to hide from the potential chaos, to warn other noncombatants, and to make sure they have access to a surface escape that isn't through the throne room, and to meet us at the tavern if he isn't here when we get back. Gorm finishes off his teaching of the other kobolds with admonishment to wash their hands carefully.

We set out the way the goblins came and left. Rahg watches us as we do so, lazily chewing some straw. After reaching the spot that Rahg had taken us to talk,
