### 2. Create a Strong Start

#### Death of Gulthias:
- As the final blow lands upon the twisted trunk of the Gulthias Tree, a resonant crack echoes through the chamber. Black sap oozes from the wounds.

- The oppressive atmosphere in the room lifts, replaced by an eerie silence. The ground beneath the tree shudders, sending tremors through the earth. The roots, once snaking through the soil like dark veins, wither and retract.

- A ghostly wail emanates from the core of the tree, a final cry of despair and rage. The bark crumbles into ash, leaving behind a hollow husk. The red glow at the tree’s heart flickers and fades and then is swallowed by darkness.

- Suddenly, a chilling wind sweeps through, carrying an unnatural cold. From that dark heart, a spectral form emerges—the spirit of Gulthias, the vampire whose cursed blood gave life to the tree. 

- With a guttural hiss, the spirit breaks free, dissipating into the night like smoke on the wind.

- The air grows cooler and fresher, as if a long-held breath has been released. The surrounding plant life, free from the tree’s corrupt influence, regains its natural hues as the taint dissipates.

#### Discovering the branch

- Amidst the ashes and debris, a faint glow catches your eye. Moving closer, you see a small branch still pulsing with a dim reddish light. Unlike the rest of the tree, this fragment seems to resist the decay.

- The branch is about a foot long, gnarled and knotted with dark veins running through it. The faint glow emanates from within, casting eerie shadows on its surface.
