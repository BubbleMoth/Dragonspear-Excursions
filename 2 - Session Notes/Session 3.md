###    Prep Checklist
####        Review the Characters
  

####        Create a Strong Start
  - The session will begin with the giant rat fighting 
  - The air is thick with tension as the giant rats surge forward, their beady eyes gleaming with hunger and aggression. Ventina stands at the forefront, her stance ready for the incoming attack. 

####        Outline Potential Scenes
  - The party attempts to travel through the caltrops and assault the goblins
  - The party seeks an alternate path to the goblins
  - The party returns to the court of **Yusdrayl** and encounter the coup happening.
  - The party travels south to explore more the fortress
  
####        Define Secrets and Clues
   - Magical Mushrooms; These are rare mushrooms that could possibly be used for culinary purposes if properly prepared.
  - The Engraved ring on the body belongs to the ranger, karakas. Ventina remembers this name... he had particularly damaged and dirty shoes. He needed them repaired before he went on an adventure. You remember him spending a lot of time talking about his friends (listed below). Bae will know the name **Harrington**. It is the name of an important merchant family... she knows the matriarch of the family has been looking for these two family members and has offered a reward if they are found.
  - These are the party members
	- The missing adventurers include:
	- A fighter (Talgen Harrington)
	- A wizard (Sharwyn Harrington) 
	- A paladin of Pelor (Sir Braford)
	- A ranger (Karakas). 
  - This fortress was home to a cult that worshiped the dragon Ashardalon.
  - Shoes?
  - The druid that currently resides in the grove of this fortress was sent almost 12 years ago to cleanse the evil within the grove. He, however, refused and was cast out from the circle. However.... the circle has recently reconnected with him and has started supporting his efforts. 
  - Explore the interests of **The Tidal Grove** 
  
####        Develop Locations
  - Still exploring the citadel; no need to develop new locations

####        Outline Important NPCs

- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Balsag|Balsag]]: 
  This version of Balsag doesn’t attack you for no reason. Instead, he can be a source of information about Belak, the Grove, and the Gulthias fruit.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Calcryx|Calcryx]]:
  Raised from an egg by Yusdrayl and her followers, Calcryx has never experienced freedom until now. She resents the kobolds that held her captive and is fiercely loyal to Rahg, who arranged her escape.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Durnn|Durnn]]:
  Durnn is not the most talkative NPC in this adventure, but even he isn’t silent either.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Gork|Gork]]:
  Gork, the bugbear gardener, can be found directly south of the entrance to Area 48. She has barklike skin and is a thrall of the Gulthias tree, tasked with protecting and researching the arboretums’ plants.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Grenl|Grenl]]:
  Grenl is the shaman of the Durbuluk council of elders, but she has now been relegated to an advising role. As the last remaining member of the Durbuluk’s previous elder council, she resents Durnn’s violent ways and believes he will be their downfall.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Kon|Kon]]:
  Kon has the kobold statblock from the Monster Manual, but they learned Spare the Dying from their husband Erky (SC Area 34). Kon is a member of the kobold colony living in the citadel, but he spends very little time there — instead, he spends most of his time attempting to hire himself out to travelers.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Meepo|Meepo]]:
  Meepo is a fan favorite of many Sunless Citadel campaign groups, largely because they lean into his general ineptitude. No need to fix something that isn’t broken, but here are some additional details for new DMs to this campaign. Meepo probably is totally unaware of the amorality of holding a sentient creature as a pet. Perhaps he misinterprets the dragon’s attempts at his life as overly affectionate love-taps. He has a kobold statblock.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Olafiel|Olafiel]]:
  Olafiel is an acolyte trained by and still loyal to Gulthias. She followed him to the citadel and has been trapped for decades. Gulthias, who was experimenting with what he’d found in the citadel, trapped her here.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Rahg|Rahg]]:
  Rahg’s short temper, backed up by his fighting prowess, has landed him a position as the captain of the guard. Known for his brutal interrogation methods, Rahg likes to use prisoners as target practice.
  
- [[Sunless Citadel; Non-Playable Characters#Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]]: 
  Yusdrayl is looking for help to contend with the goblins living nearby. She is the leader of the Ordahir, who followed her because of the promise of a healing fruit for their loved ones (or their research).
