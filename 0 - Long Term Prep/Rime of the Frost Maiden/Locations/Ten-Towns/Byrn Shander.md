Bryn Shander is the newest and probably busiest of Ten-Towns. Its buildings show less signs of age, and most have a second story. Auril's winter left many houses abandoned in other towns, but this is not the case in Bryn Shander. Many fled to this town, believing it the best place to survive the cruel cold. It is not unusual to see houses occupied by several families at once. While not a city like Waterdeep, the town is still filled with all sorts of people and races.

# Special Information
## Thieves’ Cant

Thieves cant is a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code allowing people to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation (see “Rogue” in chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook). Here is an example conversation Zarruk might have with her companions:

**Zarruk:** “Haven’t seen you two in a while.” *[we need to lay low]*

**Companion:** “Ha, you’re right, friend. How long has it been?”

**Zarruk:** “Dunno, man. Feels like forever to me. How’s your family?” *[we need to act now]*

**Companion:** “Don’t ask that, you know, it’s only nagging and shouting. I rather go to a tavern and share a drink with just Irlon here. You?” *[we work alone, no others involved]*

**Zarruk:** “Same, same.” *[I also work alone]*

**Companion:** “We were just talking about Hallan. Have you heard about his health?”

**Zarruk:** “Ahh, you know him. He will be back to good health even when the rest of us is already frozen stiff!” *[it will be an easy job]*

**Companion:** “Strange fellow. He definitely hasn’t inherited this from his old man. He’s been dead for almost thirty years.” *[payment 30 sp?]*

**Zarruk:** “Your memory must be pretty bad. He is dead for just twenty years. I am sure of it. You know what. I have some fish soup on my old brick stove home. It’s awful, I already fed some to the pigs. I need to grab some new on my way back.” *[payment 20 sp, warehouse of Brickbrow, guards were bribed, where do we stow the goods now?]*

**Companion:** “Doesn't surprise me with your lousy cooking skills. My wife can do some good. Wanna bite?” *[I know a good place]*

**Zarruk:** “Haha, sure. Let’s go.”

# Locations
## Abel’s Arcana
**Magic shoppe**

This rusty old house is home to the overweight Abelerion “Abel” Heavywood (chaotic good sun elf commoner). The bronze-skinned, blonde elf has four open locks on the front door leading customers directly into his living room. Since his life was saved by the healing hands of a cleric of Ilmater, the old elf decided to live every moment to its fullest, primarily by feasting like there is no tomorrow. Visitors to his “shop” have a 75 percent chance of finding him dining at his table. Anyone watching him devour food might believe that Icewind Dale is a land of plenty where food is abundant. He won’t let patrons interrupt his meal, pointing customers to a single cabinet filled with a seemingly random assortment of magic items. Abel will answer questions with his mouth stuffed with food. He offers a 10 percent discount to any cleric or paladin on their first purchase.

Abel is well off even in these dire days. He sells magic items to fortune-seekers and other rich folks. His assortment is nothing to brag about, but it is one of the few locations in the whole dale where magic items are sold. To determine his inventory of magic items, roll or choose up to three items from table F and one item from table G from the “Magic Items” in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide. In addition, roll or select up to three common magic items from “Common Magic Items” in chapter 2 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. Once Abel sells his last magic item, he will close his shop and travel to Waterdeep to buy new inventory. He returns to Bryn Shander after two tendays.

**Quirky Items** Abel has a strange sense of what he considers “good.” The items in his store have a 50 percent chance of having a minor property or quirk (see “Special Features” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

## Armory
**Armory and guard post**

As the name indicates, the armory stores the town’s weapons and armor, but this building also serves as the nearest guard post to the market square and has a ballista mounted on its roof. Two guards are always stationed in the small guard room. They have the key to the steel door, which separates the guard room from the storage.

When characters first arrive near the armory, they see Sheriff Markham talking in a suppressed angered voice to the two guards about the recent disappearance of weapons. If a character asks what happened, the sheriff is startled because his frustration with the guards distracted him. He gives a glance to see who else might be listening and then quickly changes the topic with a fake smile, hoping to avoid starting rumors about how incompetent his militia is.

**“Official” City Request** If Markham hasn’t met the characters, he asks if they are sellswords and offers them the job to hunt down THE snowy owlbear terrorizing the caravans near the Eastway. He will pay up to 150 gp for an owlbear’s complete and undamaged remains but will pay only a fraction of this amount if the beast‘s form is damaged in any way. He offers no further explanation. This is not an official city request but a private one from a conniving merchant. The merchant has already paid the sheriff for any owlbear’s intact remains as he is planning to discreetly sell it as a stuffed trophy to a wealthy customer in Waterdeep.

**Stolen Weapons** If characters continue to ask why the sheriff was angrily talking with the guards, he pulls them closer and tells them in a low voice of the armory’s missing weapons. He insists they keep quiet about this and will pay 50 gp if they arrest the thieves and bring back the weapons. Local thugs bribed the guards of the armory, but the guards deny knowing anything. A character succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check sees through their façade. A successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check causes the guards to reveal the truth as long as they are not in a public space. The guards feel guilty but were desperate for coin because of these dire times. The guards will share they opened the armory to a half-orc named Zarruk. They don’t know where she is but can give a decent description of her appearance and suggest asking around in lower-end taverns or inns (see “The Hooked Knucklehead” in Bryn Shander). Markham will regretfully accept this news as he assumed something like this would be the case. He will only lightly punish the guards by assigning them another duty.

## Blackiron Blades
**Smithy and outfitter**

The main room is filled with cabinets neatly organizing every piece of equipment an adventurer could need, including weapons but no armor. Each cabinet is low enough to allow a dwarf easy access to the upper shelf. Behind a dwarven-sized reception desk stands Elza (neutral good shield dwarf commoner), a 4-foot-tall dwarf with short curly copper-colored hair and a muscular build.

She sells all weapons at 75 percent of the price listed in the Player's Handbook because of their lower quality. The weapons are plain, without any decorations, and have the following trait:

**Low Quality** When you roll a 1 on your attack roll with this weapon, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed.

## Council Hall
**Meeting place for city speakers**

This building is large enough to accommodate all the council for the towns‘ irregular meetings. The large central chamber contains a spherical table with ten armchairs surrounding it. Adjacent rooms include items servants use to support speakers, including food and drink, maps of Icewind Dale, Bryn Shander, and nearby regions, as well as a lavatory. The upper floors are luxuriously furnished guest rooms for the speakers.

**Debate** There is a 20 percent chance to meet Duvessa here, meeting with the city speaker from Easthaven, Lonelywood, or Termalaine.

## Geldenstag’s Rest
**Lackluster inn**

This drafty inn is located near the east gate and run by the old widow Myrtle (lawful good Illuskan human commoner). Her husband died in a dispute with mercenaries. Myrtle is a nosey woman who asks many questions, refusing rooms to anyone who keeps secrets. Her quirk attracts honest folk who prefer a quieter stay in Bryn Shander.

Characters who are friendly and talk with Myrtle or one of her customers for 5 minutes or more can make a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they are pointed to an acquaintance in the market square where they can buy tools or adventuring gear at a 10 percent discount.

## The Hooked Knucklehead
**Trader inn**

This long-standing inn caters to traders and scrimshanders. The proprietor Barton (neutral Tethyrian human commoner) was a trader himself and a regular guest until he bought the inn. He prefers to stay out of other people‘s business.

The common room is spacious, with tables spaced far enough apart that the sound of wind whistling through cracks in the walls makes it difficult to overhear quiet conversations. Nosy characters must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to overhear other‘s conversations. The few private rooms on the second floor contain no hearths and are primarily used as trader‘s meeting rooms, with guests preferring to sleep in the common room close to the large marble fireplace.

**Stolen Weapons** The half-orc Zarruk Tuskripper (chaotic evil half-orc thug) and her two cloaked companions (thugs) are here discussing the best way to sell the weapons acquired from the armory. They speak normally but use thieves’ cant confident few will understand their conversation. No Wisdom (Perception) check is required to eavesdrop on the discussions inconspicuously. They agree to move the stolen weapons to a safer location and wait a few days, hoping for the Sheriff to calm down. The “Thieves’ Cant” sidebar offers an example discussion characters may hear. After some time, the thieves leave and walk to Tharrom’s Warehouse, a small building a

After some time, the thieves leave and walk to Tharrom’s Warehouse, a small building a few blocks from the armory. One of the thieves uses a key secretly copied from the warehouse’s owner. The stolen weapons are hidden within boxes of other stored items. The thieves then move the stolen goods to an abandoned building beside the city’s north wall.

## House of the Morninglord
**Shrine of Amaunator (god of the sun)**

Mishann removed several walls from the main building to expand its foyer into a larger worshipping area. Two wooden pews stand in front of a small dais holding a fist-sized sun forged from polished copper and enchanted with a continual flame spell.

The rest of the building contains rooms any typical house would have, including several unused guest rooms. A stair leads to the attic where the gnome Copper Knobberknocker has a private room and modest workshop.

**Healing** Characters can buy healing services from the clergy here.

## House of the Triad
**Temple of Ilmater, Torm and Tyr**

This impressive temple is made of smooth marble covered by a steep slate roof. Three corner towers rise 80 feet high, each emblazoned by a single large holy symbol representing Ilmater, Torm, or Tyr.

The 15-foot-tall double doors open into a large prayer room, with murals decorating the pillars and walls. Three simple but beautifully made statues depicting the gods of the temple stand in the back. Three entrances lead to annexes, over which rise the temple‘s towers. The high priest of each god has a room atop one of the towers.

**Ilmater’s Annex** stores medical supplies to treat the wounded and a door leading to the small outside garden.
**Torm’s Annex** contains barrack-like rooms, an armory, and a direct connection to the stable.
**Tyr’s Annex** offers an elaborate library used by the monks and priests of the temple.

**Healing** Characters can buy healing services from the clergy here.

**Foaming Mugs** Characters might also encounter the dwarves Hruna, Korux, and Storn getting their frostbitten limbs treated at the temple (see “Foaming Mugs” in chapter 1 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden).

**A Plea for Help** When characters visit the temple for the first time, they are approached by pastor Borren Farwick (lawful good Damaran human priest). He asks them if they need anything. After some conversation, he tells them about one or more towns in need of sellswords. He can share rumors from Bremen, Caer-Konig, Dougan’s Hole, Lonelywood, or Termalaine.

## Kadu’s Wondrous Scrolls
**Scrolls and inks**

The shop’s entrance is adorned with a curled sheet of copper engraved with arcane runes symbolizing a spell scroll. The interior walls are made from duskwood, helping to keep the weather and especially the humidity outside. The orderly interior includes a counter lined with decorated ink vials and pens fashioned from feathers of different birds.

Kadu “Owl” Banfyx (neutral good forest gnome illusionist) prefers to spend her days inside her shop, having as little contact with others as possible. The golden-eyed gnome wears thick spectacles. She lets customers browse her wares openly displayed in glass cases while she sits quietly behind the counter on a pile of cushions, thinking about her poems or novels. In an attempt to be polite, she created an illusion of herself which smiles and makes inviting gestures to customers.

Kadu sells spell components, inks, and a small collection of spellbooks and scrolls. She keeps exactly one copy of each scroll, quickly replenishing sold ones. Her spellbooks contain 3d6 spells, with 50 percent being 1st level spells, 30 percent being 2nd level, and 20 percent being 3rd level. Spellbooks costs are calculated from the sum of spells they contain: 25 gp for each 1st level spell, 75 gp for each 2nd level spell, and 150 gp for each 3rd level spell. She will buy spellbooks at half the price using this same formula. She can procure other spell scrolls through her contacts in Waterdeep.

If not already seen, Kadu reveals herself when a customer decides to buy or sell something. She always presents a patient and helpful personality. Consult the following table for prices.

**Kadu’s Scrolls**

| Spell | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Absorb elements, charm person, chromatic orb, comprehend languages, detect magic, disguise self, fog cloud, mage armor, magic missile, silent image, tenser’s floating disk, unseen servant | 75 gp |
| Arcane lock, blur, darkvision, hold person, invisibility, knock, locate object, mirror image, phantasmal force, see invisibility, suggestion | 150 gp |
| Blink, clairvoyance, dispel magic, hypnotic pattern, major image | 300 gp |

## Kelvin’s Comfort
**Popular tavern**

Kelvin’s Comfort is one of the most popular taverns thanks to its wide variety of dwarven ales and brandies. Rich caravanners with coin to spare frequent this establishment. The common room is decorated in dwarven fashion, and its grey painted walls give it a stone-like appearance. Axes and hammers line the walls between the paintings of mighty dwarven battles and even mightier dwarven drinking bouts. Most of the brandies are imported from Mirabar, where Ogden Flamebeard (neutral good shield dwarf commoner) still has many contacts. Ogden’s signature drink is a Mirabarian rotgut he rebottles as Flamebeard’s Firebrandy.

**Missing Mead** One exception to his many imports from south of the Spine of World is an ale from Good Mead which remains a customer favorite. If Ogden recognizes the characters as adventurers, he tries to get on their good side by offering them a free drink before casually chatting with them. If Ogden feels the characters are trustworthy, he offers to hire them to deliver two barrels of ale to Good Mead as trade for a box of bottled mead. Ogden will pay 20 gp for the service. If the characters decline, he shows his fiery temper, immediately asking them to pay up for the free drinks he provided.

**Foaming Mugs** Characters might also encounter the dwarves Hruna, Korux, and Storn here drowning the pain of their frostbitten limbs with liquor (see “Foaming Mugs” in chapter 1 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden).

## The Northlook
**Inn and tavern**

Mounted above the hearth in the common room of the Northlook tavern is the giant knucklehead trout named Ol’Bitey. A wizard cast a spell on it so that it occasionally sings the verse: “There’s a place I like to go. Farther up the river’s flow. Where it is, I do not know. Must be under all that snow.” The “Ol’Bitey’s Longing” sidebar explains this in detail.

### Ol’Bitey’s Longing

The place described in Ol’Bitey’s song actually exists. To find it, characters need to travel north of Lonelywood to where the river flows into Maer Dualdon and then follow it north about ten miles. A character who walks along the river can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check. On a success, the character discovers a 4-foot-diameter opening into the riverbank hidden beneath fog. The bottom half of the tunnel is filled with a small stream that empties into the river. A character who dives into the river finds the opening automatically.

Anybody touching the water feels that it is warm. If characters follow the narrow tunnel, they will reach a small cavern after a few hundred feet. A hot spring fills the grotto, making the air comfortably warm. Lichen covers the walls.

**Hot Spring.** Once per day, characters who spend a short rest inside the spring can reduce their level of exhaustion by 1.

**Kaant.** When this lichen is rapidly dried over a low flame, it forms fibrous strips called Kaant that accelerate a creature’s metabolism. For 8 hours after a creature chews it, the character gains advantage on saving throws to prevent exhaustion due to cold temperatures. However, Kaant rapidly depletes the body’s energy, and its users require twice the normal amount of food and water on days they use the herb (see “Herbs” in chapter 4 of DDAL00-13 Knuckleheads & Other Such Curiosities: A Travelers' Guide to Icewind Dale). There are 30 doses of Kaant that can be harvested from inside the grotto. The chamber regrows 3 doses per tenday. If the number of doses is reduced below 15, it stops regrowing for 1d4 months.

## Market Square
**Market**

The thriving market of Bryn Shander is the focal point of trade in Icewind Dale. Fishers, crafters, and merchants from the other towns all converge here. Caravans from the Sword Coast, dwarves from Ironmaster and Kelvin’s Cairn, and rarely, hunters from goliath tribes of the tundra all meet here as well. Pelts and expertly crafted scrimshaw are bartered for lumber, dyes, wine, textiles, and other wares imported from the south.

Covered in heavy winter clothes and standing next to their fiery braziers, merchants call out to customers to view their goods. Many old stalls made from weathered wood and covered with thick tarpaulin are packed close to each other to protect against the howling wind. In the center of the market stands a 9-foot-tall pole inlaid with gold and silver, engraved with holy symbols of Waukeen, goddess of trade. Around the pole lie countless copper and silver coins offered in the hope of good trade. Taking any of these coins is a sign of disrespect and shunned by the locals. Merchants will refuse to trade with anyone they see stealing these coins.

One can find nearly everything in the market square, ranging from fruits and spices to second-hand armor and weapons, though no magic items are openly traded here.

**Bad Weather** The open market offers little protection against the weather. When it becomes unbearably cold, merchants will close their stalls for the day.

## Memorial
**Statue of Tiago Baenre**

Just outside the south gate of Bryn Shander along the Ten-Trail stands a memorial visible from the city's wall. In the center of a 30-foot-circle of scorched earth atop a 2-foot-high dais stands the life-sized statue of the drow Tiago Baenre who triumphed over the balor Errtu and saved the city of Bryn Shander. The statue stands heroically, his shield resting relaxed in his left hand and his sword proudly raised to the sky. A plaque on the dais reads: “On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore.”

**Worshipper of the Frostmaiden** Nymetra (see “The Wet Trout” in Easthaven), or another worshipper of Auril, may reward 50 gp for the destruction of the memorial. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic emanating from the statue. A detect evil and good spell or similar magic reveals a demonic aura from the blackened earth. Anyone entering the area feels a sharp updraft of air from the warm temperatures inside the circle. Ranged attacks from outside the area have disadvantage against creatures inside of it. An attack against the statue transforms it into an animated armor, its sword into a flying sword, and its shield into a flying shield. All three have immunity against fire damage and are not able to leave the area.

The flying shield uses the statistics of a flying sword with the following adjustment: replace the longsword attack action with a bash dealing 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage. The shield also gains the following reaction:

**Spell Reflection** If a spell attack misses the flying shield or an allied creature within 5 feet of it, the shield can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the original target. The attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.

During the day, combat has a 50 percent chance each round to alert 1d6 guards on the wall, who rush to defend the statue. The guards need two rounds to arrive at the site. During the night, the chance to alert the guards drops to 25 percent, and they need an additional round to open the gates before reaching the area. Characters captured by the guard are put on trial. If found guilty, they must pay a fine of 100 gp each for fighting the statue or 1000 gp if they destroyed the statue and are no longer welcome in Bryn Shander.
### Adjusting the Encounter

- **Very weak:** replace Zarruk’s companions with bandits
- **Weak:** replace one of Zarruk’s companions with a bandit
- **Strong:** use the bandit captain statistics for Zarruk

## Peona’s Oils and Elixirs
**Potions & herbs**

Peona (lawful good strongheart halfling druid) runs this small establishment bordering the market square. Peona has shoulder-length black hair braided in six tails smelling faintly of roses. In front of the store sits an old copper bathtub on clawed feet. It is filled with glowing swirling liquids, which mix and separate erratically. The liquid is an accumulation of her failed creations. Characters are free to take from the tub, but she advises against drinking it as she doesn’t know what effect it will produce. Anyone who drinks or applies the liquid onto themselves is immediately affected by a Wild Magic Surge (see “Sorcerer” in chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook).

The shop’s interior is oppressively narrow, with only enough space for three Medium or Small sized creatures (including Peona). Potions, oils, lotions, ointments, and dried herbs are stacked high on shelves and reachable with attached ladders. The door behind the counter leads to her magically lit and heated greenhouse. There Peona grows all the plants necessary to produce her wares.

Peona keeps 1d4 of each of the following potions and 1 jar of keoghtom’s ointment in the locked cabinets of the shelves. Consult the following table for prices.

**Peona’s Potions**

| Potion                        | Cost  |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Keoghtom’s ointment (3 doses) | 750 gp |
| Oil of slipperiness           | 175 gp |
| Potion of animal friendship   | 125 gp |
| Potion of climbing            | 50 gp  |
| Potion of cold resistance     | 300 gp |
| Potion of fire breath         | 175 gp |
| Potion of greater healing     | 250 gp |
| Potion of growth              | 150 gp |
| Potion of healing             | 50 gp  |
| Potion of hill giant strength | 225 gp |
| Potion of water breathing     | 250 gp |

## Rendaril’s Emporium
**Trade house**

Rendaril (lawful good half-elf commoner) refurbished the old cabin that predated Bryn Shander to create his emporium. The front of the building faces the marketplace and is always kept clean, while a large entrance in the back allows traders to offload their wares.

The interior of the store resembles an upper-class jewelry shop in Waterdeep. Everything is meticulously organized and polished, displayed in masterly crafted oak cabinets and shelves. The store encompasses two floors. Rendaril and his two employees offer everything one might find in the market and more, including adventuring gear, weapons made in the Dwarven Valley, fishing rods with elven yew, yeti-skin coats with scrimshaw buttons, mithral fishhooks, and more. Rendaril knows that customers might find some things cheaper in the market, but he is more than willing to elaborate why the quality of his wares compensates for the higher price.

His centerpiece items are a mithral half-plate for 1,500 gp and an elven chain for 5,000 gp (see “Magic Items” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) presented on mannequins made from weirwood and enchanted with anti-theft wards. These armors are displayed so they are the first things seen on entry. If someone tries to move the armor while Rendaril is not within 30 feet, all doors and windows of the first-floor lock with an arcane lock spell. Additionally, weapons, shields, and armor fly from nearby shelves animating both centerpiece items into helmed horrors that attack thieves. These helmed horrors are immune to the heat metal, shatter, and shocking grasp spells.

**Other Equipment** Rendaril is willing to order other dwarven or elven crafted masterpieces for customers willing to pay up front and wait for their fabrication.

## Speaker’s Palace
**Speaker’s residence**

Among the town‘s many wooden houses, this walled two-story stone building with its slate roof feels out of place and seems as if it were magically transported here. It is the residence of Bryn Shander’s city speaker Duvessa Shane (lawful good Illuskan human noble). Duvessa is rarely found at her luxurious home, spending most of her time at the council hall or the town hall debating and negotiating.

## Stables
**Stables**

This is one of the largest buildings in town. Its entrance opens onto a stair leading up to a second floor, which is the private living space of Shratha Wolfherder (lawful good half-orc commoner) and her wife Fhai Kua (lawful neutral Sho human veteran). The second floor is centered around a common area, from which three small passages extend, each with a pair of doors opening off of them. One of these passages includes a spiral staircase returning to the ground floor, from which lively barking is heard. The ground floor consists of a huge barn divided into smaller animal kennels and a storage room for sleds. A large double door opens to the back of the building.

The two women buy, sell, and rent sleds, dogs, and axe beaks. At the moment, they have 6d10 trained dogs, 3d8 axe beaks, and 4d4 sleds to offer (see “Getting Around Ten-Towns” in chapter 1 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden).

Shratha is a soft-hearted person presenting herself as a quiet and unapproachable orc. She whispers in Fhai’s ear when she wants her to relay a message because she is embarrassed by the discrepancy between her muscular build and her heavy lisp. Fhai fell in love with her precisely because of this awkwardness. Fhai is rough around the edges but tries to be a welcoming person to support Shratha. If someone makes fun of her beloved, she gets enraged and shows people that she hasn’t forgotten her old days as an adventurer.

**Potion Cost**

| Potion                       | Cost |
|------------------------------|------|
| Keoghtom’s ointment (3 doses)| 750 gp |
| Oil of slipperiness          | 175 gp |
| Potion of animal friendship  | 125 gp |
| Potion of climbing           | 50 gp  |
| Potion of cold resistance    | 300 gp |
| Potion of fire breath        | 175 gp |
| Potion of greater healing    | 250 gp |
| Potion of growth             | 150 gp |
| Potion of healing            | 50 gp  |
| Potion of hill giant strength| 225 gp |
| Potion of water breathing    | 250 gp |

**Axe Beak Course** Shratha can teach characters how to handle axe beaks. Training takes three hours and costs 10 gp per person. To successfully learn these skills, a character must roll three DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and succeed on at least two of them. A character who passed the training no longer has disadvantage when handling axe beaks (see “Getting Around Ten-Towns” in the introduction).

**Vellynne** Fhai is working on a custom-made sled for Vellynne Harpell in the barn. It will be slightly bigger, offering enough room for her four kobolds, and will allow it to be pulled by eight instead of six dogs. There is a 25 percent chance that Vellynne is there as well, watching the progress.

## The Subtle Solution
**Esoterics and poisons**

Unlike most businesses in Bryn Shander, this store is located at the edge of the town, hidden in a little-used alleyway. One of the first things visitors notice is the strong scent of cinnamon when they enter. The pale violet tiefling Nowhere (lawful evil tiefling assassin) runs this store. She wears a ring of mind shielding containing the soul of Heask Brighttong, an infamous con-artist from Waterdeep and the last person the tiefling assassinated. Nowhere often seems absentminded during conversations as she gets easily distracted by the never-ending stream of words from Heask. She telepathically complains to Heask about this, but she hasn’t yet sold the ring, implying she is secretly grateful for the possessed spirit. Heask was the reason she quit her old job and fled to Icewind Dale.

Nowhere sells esoteric oils, incense, powders, candles, amulets, and homeopathic medicine. She describes all the wondrous effects and the correct way to use her wares to customers through a fake smile, suggesting they end neck pain, keep one warm during the coldest of nights, ward off evil, act as lucky charms, and so on. In truth, she doesn’t believe one bit in them and only repeats what Heask tells her. Each item can only be used once, and they cost between 1 and 20 gp each. Once per day, as an action, a character can use one of these items for a chance to gain inspiration for the next 24 hours. A given item has a percentage change of providing inspiration equal to its gp cost. For example, a character performing the correct rite with their 10 gp lucky charm has a 10 percent chance of gaining inspiration due to their belief in the item.

**Master Poisoner** In addition to her esoteric store, she sells poisons (see “Poisons” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide), a fact known only to people in shady circles. She still keeps her shortsword poisoned and always within reach beneath the counter.

## Tharrom’s Warehouse
**Warehouse**

This building is a warehouse in central Bryn Shander where traders can temporarily rent space to store their wares. Tharrom Brickbrow (lawful good gold dwarf commoner) is the owner, and he keeps a detailed list of every customer and their wares. The structure consists of one large room (20 feet x 40 feet) with boxes, lumber, and other trade wares neatly stacked on top of each other.

**Stolen Weapons** Zarruk Tuskripper has stored stolen weapons from the armory here (see “Armory” and “The Hooked Knucklehead” in Bryn Shander). The weapons are hidden in four wooden boxes beneath a canvas-covered shipment of lumber. The first two boxes contain ten short swords each, the third box twenty daggers, and the last box six light crossbows. The boxes are 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 1 foot high, weighing 40 pounds each.

A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a small symbol on the handle of each weapon, identifying them as city property.

If the characters don’t intervene, Zarruk and her companions move the wares to a decrepit, abandoned-looking house near the northern wall of Bryn Shander. This is actually a Zhentarim safehouse with a fortified cellar where they sell weapons to the Zhentarim who work for Targos’ city speaker Naerth Maxildanarr.

## Town Hall
**Town hall**

Bryn Shander's town hall is the largest building that borders the central square. It is reserved for community events on various holy days and celebrations. The hall was also built to house refugees from other towns in case of an emergency. Its ground floor consists of an assortment of smaller meeting rooms surrounding a large hall. They are plainly furnished allowing them to quickly turn into shelters. Several nearby storage rooms contain countless bedrolls, blankets, and stockpiles of dried food and medical supplies.

In the back of the hall, a short flight of stone steps leads to the basement. Timber beams reinforce frozen, hard-packed earth walls, while the floor is laid with smooth stone slabs. Sheriff Markham has set up his office close to the guardroom. Two dozen holding cells with steel doors are also nearby. One of his two deputies can be always found in the office willing to relay messages.

A stair in the entrance hall leads to the upper floor where the speaker's and the clerk's offices are located. Duvessa spends most of her time here, working on legislation and handling the town’s current social and logistical problems. Duvessa's goal is to advocate for unity and to mend Ten-Towns' broken relations.

A ladder at the end of the hallway leads to a narrow attic holding the town's chronicles. Dusty cabinets are filled with ancient scrolls and contracts. Diaries of former speakers sit in these shelves speaking of old times. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check, characters reading through the chronicles can find the lore of Akar Kessell's war against Ten-Towns. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they can also find lore on Jarlmoot (see “Jarlmoot” in chapter 2 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden) and Revel's End (see “Revel's End” in chapter 2 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden).

**Vellynne** There is a 25 percent chance to encounter Vellynne Harpell in a discussion with speaker Duvessa. Vellynne tries to gather information about Revel's End and the Arcane Brotherhood mage Vallish Gant (see “Revel's End” in chapter 2 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden). She also hopes to test Duvessa's willingness to cooperate or cut a deal.
