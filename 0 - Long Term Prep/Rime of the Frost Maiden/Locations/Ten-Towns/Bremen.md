Founded by dwarven prospectors, this town was ruled by barbarians for a time. Bremen has a higher number of small folk than other towns, in stark contrast to the tall humans living here. Almost half the buildings are designed for dwarvish height. Many structures were built to last, sacrificing beauty and elegance for robust and sturdy layouts. Over the years, several halflings settled here as well, hoping to put their natural luck to good use. The town is in decline. Almost half of its houses are abandoned, clearly demonstrating the severity of current times.

| **Friendliness** | üåüüåüüåü | The town is accustomed to a periodic flow of fortune hunters seeking the treasures that wash up on their shores. The townsfolk have learned that much can be gained from a little openness to strangers. |
| **Services**     | üåü     | Apart from a single shop selling trinkets of questionable usefulness, there are no other stores in town. People have little to offer and can share none of it with strangers.                            |

## Special events
### Five-Tavern Fist Fights

Roll a d100. On an 80 or lower, there will be a bar fight between 3d4 commoners. They all fight each other, but no weapons or lethal blows are allowed. On 40 or lower, characters inside or directly in front of a tavern can‚Äôt avoid being pulled into the fight. On a 20 or lower, the brawl escalates; use the lair actions listed below. The fight ends when no more than a quarter of the original combatants stand.

### Lair Actions
- 1d4 additional commoners are pulled into the fist fight.
- A chair or similar item gets thrown. A random character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.
- Someone swings with a full mug of ale. A random character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn.
- The fight becomes chaotic. Every creature with at least two other creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

### Fishing Contest

Characters who visit the central area between these taverns for the first time are met with a raucous atmosphere, as the tavern owners are hosting their quarterly fishing contest. The goal of the contest is to motivate people to replenish their supply of trout and simultaneously attract customers. The rules are simple. Everyone interested should form crews of up to four, with each crew equipped with a rowboat and fishing tackle. Whoever catches the most trout before dusk, wins four bottles of fine liquor (worth 10 gp per bottle) and free ale for the next three months in one tavern of their choice (see ‚ÄúFishing for Knucklehead Trout‚Äù in Welcome to the Far North of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden).

If characters decide to join before completing the ‚ÄúLake Monster‚Äù quest, run it during the fishing tournament (see ‚ÄúLake Monster‚Äù in chapter 1 of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden). The characters will compete against three other groups, consisting mostly of people from out of town and either oblivious of the lake monster threat or daring enough to ignore it.

After the first hour, a man gets pulled into the water by an incredibly strong trout, but his group manages to retrieve him from the lake. They immediately set course for shore hoping to save him from a cold death. When the second hour passes, the characters can see one of the remaining boats get jostled. Its passengers start to frantically bail water and head for dry land. After the third hour, the last competitors catch their fourth trout. Seemingly assured of victory, they return to shore not willing to risk themselves further.

## Locations

### Buried Treasures Inn

Dozens of objects dug up from the river decorate the common room. Lighter spots on the wood are signs of where things of value once hung for years. Now only items of symbolic or decorative value like driftwood and broken weapons remain, except for a single gold nugget in a glass case, which in truth is a painted rock. Cora, the proprietor, used the painted rock for years to inspire visitors to treasure hunt themselves.

The inn is usually cold, but if guests arrive, Cora greets them and immediately starts a fire to warm the room. She then reheats fish soup, enough for everyone. Guests staying overnight are brought to the last two furnished bedrooms in the inn. Four other rooms exist, but they lack furniture as Cora sold them out of necessity. Cora normally keeps the last remaining brazier in her room, but she gives this to any guests staying overnight, along with additional blankets. The following morning, Cora is visibly exhausted, having slept little through the freezing night. She forces a smile and waves off any concern, offering her guests another free bowl of fish soup or a heartfelt goodbye.

### Ewin‚Äôs Trinkets Curio Shop

This small store specializes in buying and selling trinkets found on Bremen‚Äôs shores. Ewin (lawful good lightfoot halfling commoner) purchased the store after a lucky find of some gold nuggets. Business has been poor since the start of Auril‚Äôs winter, but the shop remains cluttered with innumerous trinkets and baubles. Some look as if they might have value to the right person, while others look like the kind of trash a child would stuff in their pockets to keep it from being thrown away. Ewin sells his trinkets with a warning he is not responsible for any undiscovered or undesirable magical effects. He also buys small gems.

**Magical Trinkets**  
Some of this collection dates to the wizard who ran this store before Ewin. Characters can buy various strange things here (see ‚ÄúTrinkets‚Äù in chapter 5 of the Player‚Äôs Handbook or appendix A of Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden for more inspiration). A trinket has a 10 percent chance of having a minor property or quirk (see ‚ÄúSpecial Features‚Äù in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide).

**Magical Waterskin**  
A character spending at least 10 minutes searching through the giant collection can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check or cast the detect magic spell and make a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a success, the character discovers a waterskin made from Otyugh hide, which functions as a tankard of sobriety (see ‚ÄúCommon Magic Items‚Äù in chapter 2 of Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything). All liquor drunk from the waterskin has a lingering rancid taste for 10 minutes.

### Five-Tavern Center

Five unaffiliated taverns

**Tavern Fights**  
Fights occur almost every night in or around these taverns. See the ‚ÄúFive Tavern Fist Fights‚Äù sidebar for more information.

**Stones**  
The tavern is furnished in the simplest manner possible. Cracked mugs cover broken and hastily repaired tables. The owner gave up replacing damaged furniture because of the never-ending barfights. Whatever decorations the common room once held are long destroyed and thrown out. The tavern gets its name from the polished river rocks the barkeep Duff Kilm (chaotic neutral Turami human bandit) puts at the bottom of every tankard of ale. If a drinker drains the cup at a single go, the stone rolls gently down to the lip of the tankard, but patrons who delicately sip at their beer will get a crack in the teeth when they throw back the last of their drink.

**The Grumpy Moose & The Bearded Brother**  
Two different-looking adjacent houses with separate tavern signs and entrances lead into a joint common room. The connecting wall collapsed during a violent bar fight, which only escalated the brawl further. After calming down, the arguing brothers who owned the houses saw the merit of two doors leading into a single tavern. One sells ale, while the other tries to win over guests with strong liquor. The original brothers are long gone (or perhaps never existed), but the tradition is kept alive by the current owners Jalurn Bhiln (neutral shield dwarf commoner) and Vormul Marftid (lawful neutral gold dwarf commoner). They often argue and shout profanities at one another to the amusement of the patrons, but they always put the interest of the combined tavern over their frequent quarrels.

**Even Keel**  
Proprietor Kalxom Pack Twistnipper (chaotic good rock gnome commoner) has a sour demeanor and frequently tells cynical jokes likely a result of being exiled from his original home. His attitude has made it difficult to win over customers. He tries to combat this by creating a pleasant atmosphere, using small clockwork constructs to play soothing music, and adding herbs to give his ale a unique spicy flavor. Hard-pressed by nearby competition, Kalxom tried to copy the combined tavern idea by buying the abandoned tavern next to his.

**The River‚Äôs Mouth**  
The tavern‚Äòs windows are tinted, making it impossible to see inside, but a welcoming, warm light and soft music emanate from within. In truth, the tavern is empty, having recently been purchased by Kalxom from the Even Keel next door. Behind every window sits an oil lamp while a small clockwork construct plays the same tune all night, though the rest of the building is empty and neglected. Customers entering the tavern are directed through a narrow hallway of makeshift walls. This passage turns sharply right, ending at a door opening into the Even Keel tavern.

### Riverbanks of Shaengarne River

**Frozen Treasures**  
Bremen is known for the treasures and trinkets which get washed upon its riverbanks after the early summer‚Äôs seasonal floods. Auril‚Äôs winter froze the water and brought an abrupt halt to this, depriving Bremen of its touristic treasure hunters. But there are still valuables to be found beneath the ice. A character who prospects on the beach for at least 1 hour has a 50 percent chance of finding something. Roll a d6 and consult the Treasures Beneath the Ice table to see what the character finds. It takes 1 hour to break the item out of the ice using a tool like a pickaxe. Every item can only be found once. Rolling the same result on the table again means the character finds nothing.

### Town Hall

**Town hall (and speaker‚Äôs residence)**

This small building was used for town planning, particularly the annual floods that plagued the town. Nowadays, sporadic emergencies shifted to ever-lingering burdens, leaving the town hall largely unused. Unreadable stone tablets, ruined paintings in moldy frames, broken parts of a giant‚Äôs massive weapon, and other peculiar finds from the shores sit on shelves as a reminder of a more prosperous past.

**Speaker‚Äôs Chambers**

The upper floor‚Äôs height was built to accommodate dwarves. There is a 50 percent chance that the speaker‚Äôs rooms are abandoned, with speaker Dorbulgruf wandering confused along a shore or riverbank. The rooms‚Äô tidiness contrasts with the abundance of strangely misplaced objects: paintings have been taken from the walls and placed on chairs, dishes stacked on the floor, flowers lie neatly sorted next to their vases, important documents rolled up and stored in winter clothing, and so on.
