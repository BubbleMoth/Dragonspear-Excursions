In her childhood, Caelyn Hawthorne was happy and carefree. She spent most of her time with her best friend, an elven girl named Arineth. Both had natural magical talents, which drew the attention of a local wizard, Master Sylas. Though he recognized the  potential in both girls, he could only take a single apprentice and chose Arineth. Caelyn was crushed... she knew she was just as good with magic as Arineth. The two stayed in contact via letter,  Arineth telling Caelyn of all the wonderful magic she was learning. Caelyn always replied with joy and enthusiasm for her friend, but in truth, she was filled with filled with jealousy and anger.

In search of her own path and seeking a way to overcome her jealousy, Caelyn sought ways to study magic on her own. She’d heard rumors of a druidic circle in the coastal town of Moonwave Harbor. There, she met a druid named Elarion. Impressed by her magical abilities (and perhaps a bit charmed by her warm smile), Elarion took her under his wing. He taught her the druidic ways and introduced her to his circle, The Tidal Grove, where she was warmly welcomed. Caelyn found a sense of purpose among them, immersing herself in their teachings and finding comfort in the close-knit community. Her dedication quickly earned her a position of power within the circle. Despite her accomplishments, she struggled with insecurities about her skills, her lifespan compared to the elves, and fears of rejection. Over time, she fell deeply in love with Elarion, but these insecurities held her back from ever confessing her true feelings to him.

Arineth, having heard of Caelyn’s success within Moonwave Harbor, decided to visit her old friend to reconnect and celebrate her achievements. She missed her old friend and was proud of what she had accomplished. The two friends reconnected, and for a time, the jealousy within Caelyn seemed to fade. But when Caelyn introduced Arineth to Elarion, she saw the way he looked at her… the way he talked to her. Even though there was nothing between her two friends, Caelyn convinced herself that Elarion was interested in Arineth.

To prove herself superior to both Elarion and Arineth, Caelyn convinced them to assist her in performing an druidic ritual to protect Moonwave Harbor from an approaching Hurricane. She knew this ritual was dangerous, but she had to prove that she was as powerful as Arineth. No... that she was more powerful. 

Everything seemed to be going well at first, but something happened. Instead of the storm being gently pushed away, it responded in anger. Intensifying and heading for the town even quicker. Caelyn and her two friends tried to wrest control of the storm, but it was to no avail and the storm smashed into the town.

In the ensuing chaos, Elarion, Arineth, and most of her druidic circle were caught in the storm surge and lost their lives. As she succumbed to the very forces she sought to control, Caelyn witnessed the devastation and the loss of her best friend the man she loved,  and the family that had taken her in. Her last thoughts were filled with regret and horror at the lives lost because of her actions.

In the Nine Hells, Caelyn was tormented by visions of the lives she envied, making her realize the depth of her jealousy. She relived the tragedy, haunted by the deaths of Elarion and Arineth. The Conclave of Halruaa, recognizing the potential for redemption, resurrected Caelyn, offering her a chance to atone for her actions.
