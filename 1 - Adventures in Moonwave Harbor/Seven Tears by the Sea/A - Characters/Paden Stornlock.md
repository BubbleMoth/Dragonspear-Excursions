### **Overview**
Paden Stornlock is the patriarch of the Stornlock family and a central figure in the backstory of the adventure. He was once a wealthy and ambitious man who made a dark pact with the fey sea hag, [[Brinemouth Marcail]], in exchange for wealth and power. This pact ultimately led to the curse that has befallen his wife, [[Iona Stornlock]], and the gradual decay of his family's legacy.

### **Appearance**
Paden is a tall, imposing figure with graying hair and a weathered face that speaks of years of worry and regret. His eyes are often downcast, burdened by the weight of the choices he has made. He dresses in fine, though now slightly worn, clothing that hints at his family's former glory, with hints of sea motifs subtly woven into the fabric.

### **Personality**
Paden is a deeply conflicted man, torn between his desire for power and the love he has for his family. His ambition led him down a dark path, and now he is haunted by the consequences of his actions. He is often absent from [[Stornlock Manor]], either seeking a way to undo the curse or avoiding the painful reality of what he has caused. His once commanding presence has given way to a man weighed down by guilt and despair.

### **Backstory**
Years ago, Paden entered into a pact with [[Brinemouth Marcail]], a powerful fey sea hag, in exchange for wealth and influence. The pact brought him temporary success, but it also came with a terrible price: his wife, [[Iona Stornlock]], was cursed, and his family's legacy was tainted. Paden has spent years trying to find a way to break the curse, but his efforts have only led to further despair and isolation. His dealings with the fey have left a mark on him, both physically and spiritually, making him a shell of the man he once was.

### **Role in the Story**
- **The Pact**: Paden's deal with the fey is the root cause of the events in the story. His actions set the stage for the curse that afflicts [[Iona Stornlock]] and the dangers that now threaten [[Stornlock Manor]] and its surroundings.
- **Absent Father**: Paden is mostly absent during the events of the adventure, leaving his son, [[Ewan Stornlock]], and the players to deal with the fallout of his decisions. His whereabouts are unknown, adding an element of mystery to the story. There are whispers that he has sought refuge in places connected to the sea, searching for answers in ancient lore or hidden coves.
- **Final Resolution**: Depending on the players' actions, Paden may return in the epilogue, seeking to atone for his mistakes. His fate is tied to whether or not he repents and sheds seven tears by the sea, a ritual that could potentially reunite him with his family during Summertide. However, this resolution is fraught with uncertainty, as the fey do not easily release those who have bargained with them.

### **Conclusion**
Paden Stornlock is a tragic figure whose ambition and subsequent regret drive much of the story's conflict. His legacy is a cautionary tale about the dangers of dealing with dark forces, and his character arc is central to the emotional depth of the adventure. His ultimate fate, whether one of redemption or further tragedy, is deeply tied to the actions of the players and the choices they make.
