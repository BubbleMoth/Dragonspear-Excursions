### **Overview**
Brinemouth Marcail is a powerful and malevolent fey sea hag who serves as the primary antagonist in the adventure. She is the one who cursed [[Iona Stornlock]] as part of a dark pact with [[Paden Stornlock]]. Marcail dwells in the [[Sunken Cathedral of Umberlee]], where she weaves her dark magic and plots to extend her influence over the seas and coastal towns.

### **Appearance**
Tangled hair drifts around her gaunt, coral-encrusted face, where glowing eyes peer from the shadows. Jagged teeth flash beneath a twisted grin, while spines jut from her mottled gray-green form. She wears tattered, seaweed-like robes that cling to her, adorned with shells and bits of coral, as if the ocean itself has woven her attire.

### **Personality**
Marcail is cruel, manipulative, and utterly devoid of compassion. She delights in the suffering of others and takes pleasure in corrupting those who seek her aid. Her power and influence are matched only by her cunning, making her a dangerous foe for the players.

### **Backstory**
Brinemouth Marcail has existed for centuries, preying on sailors, fishermen, and coastal dwellers who are desperate enough to make deals with her. She granted [[Paden Stornlock]] wealth and power, but in return, she cursed his wife, [[Iona Stornlock]], to further her own ends. Marcail sees herself as an agent of chaos, serving the will of the sea goddess [[Umberlee]] while pursuing her own twisted goals.

### **Role in the Story**
- **The Curse**: Marcail is the one who placed the curse on [[Iona Stornlock]], setting the events of the adventure in motion. The players must confront her in order to lift the curse and save Iona
# Dialogue (Combat)

### **Initial Encounter:**

_As the players enter the sanctum of the Sunken Cathedral, they find Brinemouth Marcail standing by the dark altar, her eyes gleaming with malicious glee. She cackles as she notices them:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Heh heh heh... So, you’ve come to unravel the threads of fate, have you? Such fools, thinking you can untangle the web of the deep."

### **Discussing the Curse and Pact:**

_If the players confront her about the curse afflicting **Iona Stornlock**:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"*cackling* There’s no curse, you witless landwalkers! Only the consequences of a broken Fey Pact and greed... Unchecked fishin’, draining the sea dry! It was only a matter of time before the ocean took its due."

_She continues, her voice dripping with contempt:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Poor, pathetic **Paden**... He made his bed with the sea, and now the waves come crashing down. He struck a bargain with the fey, thinking he could have it all. But the sea’s generosity is short-lived, and when he failed to uphold his end... well, let’s just say the ocean has a way of collecting its debts."

_If the players press for more details:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"*sneering* You think you can mend what’s been broken? That’s not for me to decide, and certainly not for you. But if you’re so keen on fixing things, why not start with the mess you call your lives? Heh heh heh..."

### **Taunting the Players:**

_If the players begin to question her further or hesitate:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"You think you can save her, don’t you? There’s more to that woman than you know... but what difference does it make? The sea always reclaims what is hers."

### **During the Battle:**

_If the players engage her in combat:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Fools! You meddle in forces far greater than yourselves. The sea has no mercy, and neither do I!"

_As she summons her powers:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Let the tides rise and drown you all! You’ll find no salvation in these depths!"

### **Defeat or Retreat:**

_If the players manage to defeat or weaken her:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"You think you’ve won? *cackling weakly* You’re only delaying the inevitable. The sea’s hunger is unending... it will swallow you all, sooner or later."

# Dialogue (non-combat)

### **Initial Encounter:**

_As the players approach the altar where Brinemouth Marcail stands, she turns to face them, her eyes narrowing in suspicion:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Heh, what’s this? You approach me without drawing steel? A rare sight indeed. Speak, then. What brings you to the depths, little landwalkers?"

### **Discussing the Pact and Iona's Affliction:**

_If the players inquire about the curse afflicting **Iona Stornlock**:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"*cackling* Curse? You misunderstand, fools. There’s no curse—only the price of broken promises and greed. **Paden Stornlock** made a pact with the fey, a pact he was too weak to uphold. Now the sea reclaims what is hers."

_She pauses, studying the players with a twisted grin:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"But why should I tell you more? What is it you seek? Do you think you can undo what has been done? Do you believe you can save the poor woman?"

_If the players express their desire to help **Iona Stornlock**:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Heh, how noble. But do you even know who you’re trying to save? There’s more to that woman than meets the eye. Still, if you insist on meddling in matters you barely comprehend, there may be a way..."

### **Negotiating or Seeking Information:**

_If the players ask how they can help or what they need to do:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"The seal pelt... yes, that is the key. But it has lost its power, drained by time and neglect. To restore it, you’ll need more than just good intentions. You’ll need to call upon the magic of the sea itself. Perform the ritual, and perhaps... just perhaps, you might break the chains that bind her."

_She looks at them with a mixture of amusement and disdain:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"But be warned: the sea does not give without taking. If you wish to proceed, you must be prepared to pay the price. Now, what will it be, landwalkers? Will you face the depths, or will you turn back and let the tides have their way?"

### **Leaving Peacefully:**

_If the players choose to leave without fighting:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Wise, perhaps. Or maybe just cowardly. Either way, the sea will have its due, one way or another. Go, then. But remember, the ocean is always watching, always waiting."

_She turns back to her altar, dismissing them with a wave of her hand:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Your fate is sealed, whether you know it or not. Tread carefully, little landwalkers. The sea is patient, but it is also unforgiving."


# Talisman

### **Hinting at Iona’s Talisman:**

_If the players inquire about how they can save **Iona Stornlock**:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Ah, so you seek to save her, do you? How quaint. But the bond that holds her is not easily broken. To restore her, you’ll need something... something precious, something tied to the sea itself."

_She paces slowly, her eyes glinting with malice:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"This talisman, this... key, must be more than just a trinket. It must represent a creature of the sea, one that shares its essence with the ocean’s depths. And it must have come to her with the tides, bound to her from the moment she arrived."

_She pauses, watching the players intently:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"But such an object is not easily found. It must possess its own magic, an inherent power that could only be granted by the sea. Without it, you will find nothing but failure and despair."

_She leans in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper:_

**Brinemouth Marcail:**  
"Search carefully, little ones. The answer lies closer than you think, hidden in plain sight... if only you know where to find it"
