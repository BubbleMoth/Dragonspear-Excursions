### **Overview**
Iona Stornlock is the matriarch of the [[Stornlock]] family and a key figure in the adventure. She is a selkie—a being who can transform between a seal and a human—who has been afflicted by a mysterious curse due to a broken fey pact made by her husband, [[Paden Stornlock]].

### **Appearance**
In her human form, Iona is a striking woman with long, flowing auburn hair and pale skin. Her eyes are a deep, oceanic blue, hinting at her connection to the sea. In her selkie form, she appears as a sleek, graceful seal with the same distinctive blue eyes.

### **Personality**
Iona is gentle and nurturing, deeply caring for her son, [[Ewan Stornlock]], and the well-being of her family. However, the curse has left her in a weakened and comatose state, unable to protect herself or communicate with her loved ones.

### **Backstory**
Iona was once a carefree selkie who fell in love with [[Paden Stornlock]]. She chose to remain with him on land, hiding her true nature. However, Paden's dark deal with the fey sea hag, [[Brinemouth Marcail]], eventually led to Iona being cursed. Her seal pelt, the source of her selkie power, was hidden away, and without it, she became vulnerable to the curse that now keeps her in a comatose state.

### **Role in the Story**
- **Central Mystery**: Iona's condition is the driving force behind the players' investigation. Her comatose state and the mystery of her true identity as a selkie are key elements of the plot.
- **The Talisman**: The players must recover Iona's seal pelt, which is hidden within [[Stornlock Manor]], and use it in a ritual to awaken her and lift the curse.
- **Transformation**: In the story's climax, after the players succeed in breaking the curse, Iona transforms back into her selkie form, reuniting with her son and returning to the sea.

### **Conclusion**
Iona Stornlock is the emotional heart of the adventure. Her tragic backstory and the mystery surrounding her condition provide a compelling motivation for the players, and her eventual transformation serves as a poignant resolution to the story.
