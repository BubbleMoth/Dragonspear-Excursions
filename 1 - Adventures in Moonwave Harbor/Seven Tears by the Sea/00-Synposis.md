## **Chapter 2: Hunt the Hag**

### **1. Exploring the Cave System:**
   - **Discovery of the Natural Cave System:** The players uncover a hidden entrance to a cave system on the grounds of [[Stornlock Manor]]. The cave is damp, with walls covered in bioluminescent fungi, and the sound of distant water echoes through the tunnels.
   - **Navigating the Caves:** The players make their way through the winding paths, facing minor environmental challenges like slippery rocks and narrow passages. They might also encounter small, aquatic creatures or remnants of past explorers.
   - **Reaching the Undersea Hut:** After descending deeper into the cave, the players find a submerged tunnel that leads to a large air bubble under the sea. Inside this bubble is a small hut, surrounded by a garden of coral and other undersea flora.

### **2. Encountering [[Brinemouth Marcail]]:**
   - **The Sea Hag’s Hut:** The players approach the small, weathered hut, which seems out of place in its underwater surroundings. The garden behind the hut is filled with strange, glowing corals and other undersea plants that pulse with faint light.
   - **Meeting [[Brinemouth Marcail]]:** As the players enter or approach the hut, [[Brinemouth Marcail]] emerges, her appearance unsettling but not immediately hostile. She eyes the players warily, ready to defend herself if needed.

### **3. Dialogue or Combat:**
   - **Talking to the Hag:** If the players choose to speak with her, [[Brinemouth Marcail]] listens with a mixture of amusement and curiosity. She explains the broken fey pact that led to [[Iona Stornlock]]’s affliction and hints at the nature of the talisman needed to save her.
   - **Combat Option:** If the players choose to attack, [[Brinemouth Marcail]] will immediately turn invisible, using her knowledge of the underwater environment to flee. She may leave behind some clues or items that hint at the information she would have provided.

### **4. The Sea Hag’s Explanation:**
   - **Revealing the Curse:** Through dialogue, [[Brinemouth Marcail]] explains that there is no curse in the traditional sense—only the consequences of a broken fey pact made by [[Paden Stornlock]]. She hints at the importance of [[Iona Stornlock]]’s talisman without directly revealing it, suggesting that the players must find an object that represents a sea creature, arrived with [[Iona Stornlock]], and holds inherent magic.
   - **Hints About the Talisman:** She describes the talisman in cryptic terms, encouraging the players to piece together the clues and discover its identity. She warns them that without the talisman, they have no hope of saving [[Iona Stornlock]].

### **5. Leaving the Undersea Hut:**
   - **After the Encounter:** Depending on how the players interact with [[Brinemouth Marcail]], they may leave the hut with a better understanding of the situation, or they may leave empty-handed if they chose to fight.
   - **Returning to [[Stornlock Manor]]:** With the information gathered, the players return to [[Stornlock Manor]], now with a clearer sense of what they need to do to break the bond that holds [[Iona Stornlock]].

## **Chapter 3: What Was Stolen**

### **1. Return to [[Stornlock Manor]]:**
   - **Arrival at the Manor:** The players return to [[Stornlock Manor]], only to find [[Ewan Stornlock]] and [[All-Purpose Dan]] loading a ship with the family’s wealth. The ship is moored at a small dock near the manor, and [[Ewan Stornlock]] seems determined to set sail.
   - **Confrontation:** The players discover that [[Ewan Stornlock]] plans to make an offering to Umberlee, the Bitch Queen, in a desperate attempt to save his mother. He believes that by giving all of the family’s wealth to the sea goddess, she might show mercy and lift the affliction from [[Iona Stornlock]].

### **2. Seeking Help from [[Ewan Stornlock]] or [[All-Purpose Dan]]:**
   - **Dialogue with [[Ewan Stornlock]]:**
     - If the players speak with [[Ewan Stornlock]], they can persuade him to listen to reason. [[Ewan Stornlock]] is desperate but willing to help if the players can convince him that there’s another way to save his mother. He might express uncertainty about the talisman but will recall his mother always kept a special object close by when they were near the sea.
   - **Conversation with [[All-Purpose Dan]]:**
     - [[All-Purpose Dan]] is more pragmatic and less emotional than [[Ewan Stornlock]]. He’s aware of the family’s history and may have seen the talisman in [[Iona Stornlock]]’s possession before. He can give the players more specific guidance, suggesting they search places where [[Iona Stornlock]] kept her most treasured items.

### **3. Locating the Talisman:**
   - **Search for Clues:** With [[Ewan Stornlock]] or [[All-Purpose Dan]]’s help, the players can begin searching for the talisman. They might be directed to [[Iona Stornlock]]’s private quarters, a hidden chest in the manor, or even the place where the family would spend time near the sea.
   - **Finding the Seal Pelt:** The players eventually find the seal pelt, hidden away in a place of significance to [[Iona Stornlock]]. It’s clear that this object is more than just a keepsake—it’s the key to saving her.

## **Chapter 4: Breaking the Bond**

### **1. Performing the Ritual:**
   - **Revitalizing the Talisman:** The players must now use the information gathered from [[Brinemouth Marcail]] and their own knowledge to perform the ritual to restore the pelt’s magic. This might involve invoking the sea’s power, using specific items found during their journey, and aligning the ritual with certain environmental conditions.
   - **Awakening [[Iona Stornlock]]:** Once the ritual is complete, the players place the revitalized pelt on [[Iona Stornlock]]. Slowly, the magic takes hold, and she begins to stir, her form shifting back to her true selkie nature.

### **2. Confronting the Consequences:**
   - **[[Ewan Stornlock]]’s Reaction:** [[Ewan Stornlock]] is overwhelmed with relief and gratitude, but he is also conflicted about the drastic steps he was about to take. He may seek the players’ advice on what to do next or express regret for nearly giving away the family’s fortune.
   - **[[All-Purpose Dan]]’s Perspective:** [[All-Purpose Dan]] remains grounded, reminding [[Ewan Stornlock]] that while the immediate crisis has been averted, the family still has challenges ahead. He may suggest that the family find a way to honor the pact with the sea or make amends for the broken promises of the past.

### **3. Resolution:**
   - **Reunion:**  
     - **Iona’s Confession:** After the ritual is complete, [[Iona Stornlock]] confesses to her son that she is a selkie. [[Ewan Stornlock]] professes his unconditional love for his mother, regardless of her form, and gives his blessing for her to return to the ocean. [[Iona Stornlock]] transforms into her seal form, and [[Ewan Stornlock]] assists her into the water, where she swims happily in the cove.
     - **Ewan’s Gift:** [[Ewan Stornlock]] thanks the party for their help and hands them a key, informing them that their reward waits for them in the basement vault of [[Stornlock Manor]]. He expresses a desire to be alone with his mother, so [[All-Purpose Dan]] rows the party ashore to receive their reward.
   - **The Transformation:**  
     - **Ewan’s Transformation:** As the party rows a short distance away from the ship, [[Ewan Stornlock]] emits a painful shriek as he too transforms into a seal. He then leaps into the water to join his mother. As the two selkies swim away, dozens of other seals emerge from the cove, playing, catching fish, and barking with glee.
   - **The Kraken’s Attack:**  
     - **The Tragic Twist:** Once the herd of selkies swims far enough from the boat containing the entire wealth of the [[Stornlock]] family, a kraken commanded by [[Brinemouth Marcail]] emerges and sinks the ship, adding it to the treasure hoard of its master. As the ship goes down, the players hear [[Brinemouth Marcail]]’s greedy cackling on the wind.

### **Conclusion**
Chapter 4 brings the adventure to an emotional and dramatic close. The players witness the true nature of [[Iona Stornlock]] and [[Ewan Stornlock]], see the reunion of mother and son, and experience the bittersweet end of the [[Stornlock]] family’s legacy. The players’ actions have directly impacted the outcome, leaving them with a sense of accomplishment—and perhaps a lingering sense of loss as they see the family’s wealth lost to the depths.
