> The parlor is a quiet, dimly lit space where a richly patterned rug covers the floor, and a harpsichord sits unused in the corner. Two armchairs face a low wooden table, while a bookcase on the far wall is filled with forgotten tomes. The air is tinged with the scent of old wood and dried flowers.

> Attached to the parlor, the dining room features a long wooden table set with tarnished silverware and a few chipped plates. A deep red carpet underfoot contrasts with the dark wood paneling, and a chandelier hangs above, casting flickering light. Heavy curtains drape the bay windows, sealing the room in a perpetual twilight.
