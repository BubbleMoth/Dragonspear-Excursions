A large, well-made bed with dark, intricately patterned bedding occupies one corner of the room. A small chest is placed at the foot of the bed. Opposite the bed, a desk is set against the wall, with a chair pulled up to it. The desk is clean, with only a few scattered papers and a vase of fresh flowers on one side. A shipâ€™s wheel is mounted on the wall above a cushioned bench near the window, adding a nautical touch to the room.

A door leads to a small adjoining bathroom where a freestanding bathtub is the central feature. A circular rug lies beneath the tub, and a small table sits in the corner of the bathroom, possibly for personal items. A large, ornate mirror is positioned next to the wardrobe near the entrance, reflecting the room's subdued lighting and dark, luxurious decor.Pade
