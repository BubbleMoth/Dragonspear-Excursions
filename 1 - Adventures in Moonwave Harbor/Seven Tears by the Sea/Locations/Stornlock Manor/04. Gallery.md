> The gallery room is adorned with a deep purple carpet that stretches across the floor, with dark wood paneling along the walls. Three marble statues are displayed on stone pedestals. A large statue at one end of the room depicts a stern-faced woman with flowing hair, her form entwined with sea creatures, symbolizing the power and fury of the ocean. Two smaller busts are positioned closer to the center of the room.
