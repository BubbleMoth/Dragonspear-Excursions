***Bedroom:***  
*The bedroom contains two small beds, each with a chest at the foot. A plush toy rests on one of the beds. A small bookcase against the wall holds neatly arranged books and a few scattered toys. An old babyâ€™s crib sits beneath the window, resting on a large white seal pelt, its texture soft and well-kept. A strange and colorful mounted fish hangs on the wall above the crib. An open doorway leads into the adjoining playroom.*

***Playroom:***  
*The playroom features a colorful circular rug in the center. Wooden toys and instruments are strewn about. A toy castle stands at the opposite end of the room, with a small rocking horse, plush animals, and a toy chest partially open with toys spilling out.*
