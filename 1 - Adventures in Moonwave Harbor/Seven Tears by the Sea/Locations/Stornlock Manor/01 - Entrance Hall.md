> The entrance hall features a deep red carpet that runs the length of the room, leading to the central staircase. Above the staircase hangs a large oil painting of the Stornlock family, displaying a handsome-yet-weary Paden Stornlock with his arm resting on the shoulder of a seated Iona. Her face turns slightly, gazing out of the frame as she wears an extravagant gown and a Giant Shark-tooth Pendant. A young Ewan stands beside his father, holding his motherâ€™s hand. Portraits of stern-faced ancestors adorn the walls, and a candle chandelier hangs above, casting flickering light. An ornate mirror on one wall reflects the room. Several doors lead off from the hall, their frames standing quietly, hinting at what lies beyond. The air is filled with the scent of old wood and sea air.
