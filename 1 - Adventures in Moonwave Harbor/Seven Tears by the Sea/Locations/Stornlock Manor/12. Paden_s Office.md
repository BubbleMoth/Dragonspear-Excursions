The door to this room is slightly ajar, revealing a spacious office. A large oak and leather writing desk occupies one side, with a giant pearl sitting atop it, emitting a shimmering glow that illuminates the scattered documents and writing tools. Shelves filled with neatly arranged books and scrolls line one wall. A plush red couch is positioned near the center of the room on a deep purple rug with a circular pattern.

In one corner, a small hearth is stocked with firewood, and a lute rests against the wall nearby.
