The small bathroom features a simple tiled floor, with a weathered washbasin set into a marble countertop on one side. A round, metal-framed mirror hangs above it, slightly tarnished around the edges. To the side, a small, round tub sits partially filled with stagnant water. The air is cool and carries a faint musty odor, mingled with the scent of aged soap.
