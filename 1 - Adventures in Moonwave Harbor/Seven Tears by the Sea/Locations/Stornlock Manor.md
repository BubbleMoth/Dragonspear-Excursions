 
### **Overview**
Stornlock Manor is the ancestral home of the Stornlock family, located close to Moonwave hallow. The manor is a large, imposing structure that reflects the family's once-great status but now carries an air of melancholy and decay due to the dark secrets it harbors.

### **Key Characters**
- **[[Iona Stornlock]]**: The lady of the house, a selkie who has been afflicted by a mysterious ailment due to a broken fey pact.
- **[[Paden Stornlock]]**: The absent lord of the manor, who made a dark deal with the fey sea hag, [[Brinemouth Marcail]], to gain wealth and a family.
- **[[Ewan Stornlock]]**: The young son of Iona and Paden, who seeks help from the players to save his mother.

### **Exterior Description**
Stornlock Manor is a grand but weathered building situated on the outskirts of [[Brimshore Bay]]. The manor is surrounded by overgrown gardens and a wrought-iron fence that has begun to rust with age. The sea breeze carries a salty tang that mixes with the scent of decaying wood and damp stone.

- **Architecture**: The manor’s architecture is a mix of Gothic and coastal styles, with tall, narrow windows, steep gables, and a slate roof that has seen better days. Ivy climbs the stone walls, partially obscuring the carved reliefs of waves and sea creatures.
- **Grounds**: The manor is set on a cliff overlooking the sea, with a neglected garden that once boasted exotic plants and well-tended hedges. Now, it is a tangle of weeds and wildflowers, with broken statues and a dry fountain that hint at its former grandeur.

### **Interior Description**
The interior of Stornlock Manor is dark and musty, with the scent of old wood and sea air permeating every room. The once-lavish furnishings are now covered in dust, and the wallpaper has started to peel away from the damp walls.

- **Main Hall**: The entrance hall is dimly lit by flickering candles in wall sconces. A grand staircase leads up to the upper floors, with portraits of stern-looking ancestors lining the walls. The floors are creaky wooden planks, and the air is thick with a sense of foreboding.
- **Drawing Room**: This room is furnished with faded velvet chairs and a large, intricately carved fireplace that has not been used in years. A grand piano sits in the corner, its keys covered in dust. The room was once a place of family gatherings but now feels cold and empty.
- **Dining Room**: The long dining table is covered in a heavy cloth, with tarnished silverware and cracked china set for a meal that was never served. The large bay windows are draped in heavy, moth-eaten curtains, blocking out the gray light from outside.
- **Kitchen**: The kitchen is a large, functional space with a massive stone hearth. The room is cluttered with old pots and pans, and the pantry is stocked with preserved foods long past their prime. A faint smell of saltwater lingers here, mixing with the stale air.

### **Key Locations Within the Manor**

- **Iona’s Bedroom**: Iona lies in a comatose state here, attended by concerned household staff. The room is dimly lit, with heavy drapes pulled shut. The air is thick with the scent of salt and damp, and the sound of the sea can be faintly heard through the walls. Players can examine her condition and gather clues about the nature of her affliction.

- **Ewan’s Playroom**: A small, cluttered room filled with toys and books. The seal pelt, crucial to Iona’s true identity, is hidden here under a crib. The room has an eerie stillness, with toys that seem to have been left untouched for some time.

- **Paden’s Office**: A study filled with bookshelves, old maps, and nautical instruments. The giant pearl that the players discover is located here. The office is neatly kept, with a large desk cluttered with papers, some of which hint at the dark deal Paden made with the fey.

- **Secret Passageways**: The manor contains several hidden passageways that lead to various parts of the house. These can be discovered by perceptive players and may offer shortcuts or hidden treasures.

### **Encounters and Events**
- **Initial Investigation**: When the players first arrive, they are free to explore the manor and gather clues about Iona’s condition, Paden’s whereabouts, and the history of the Stornlock family.

- **Revelations**: As the players uncover more about the manor, they may experience unsettling events—such as whispers in empty rooms, cold drafts, or visions of the past—that hint at the fey influence and the darkness that has settled over the family.

- **Final Return**: After the players confront [[Brinemouth Marcail]] and obtain the items needed to save Iona, they return to the manor for the final ritual. The manor becomes a place of hope or despair, depending on the players' success in lifting the curse.

### **Conclusion**
Stornlock Manor is a place of mystery, sorrow, and potential redemption. It plays a central role in the adventure as both the beginning and end of the players’ journey, and its haunting atmosphere should leave a lasting impression on those who explore its halls.
