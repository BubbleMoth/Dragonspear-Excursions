### **Overview**
The Sunken Cathedral of Umberlee is a grand, haunting structure dedicated to the sea goddess Umberlee. Located beneath the waves near [[Barking Cove]], the cathedral is partially submerged, with its halls filled with water, coral, and ancient relics. It serves as the lair of the fey sea hag, [[Brinemouth Marcail]], and is the site of the final confrontation in the adventure.

### **Key Features**
- **Entrance Hall**: The grand entrance to the cathedral is a partially submerged chamber, with water lapping at the ancient stone walls. The players must solve a puzzle or make an offering to gain entry, appeasing the sea goddess Umberlee.
- **Hall of Waves**: A central hall within the cathedral where the players navigate rising and falling tides. The shifting terrain makes it difficult to maintain footing, and the hall is filled with aquatic creatures that guard the temple.
- **Sacred Pools**: Enchanted pools scattered throughout the cathedral, each with varying effects. Some pools offer healing, while others are cursed, causing harm or creating illusions. The players can interact with these pools to gain temporary boons or to uncover hidden relics.
- **Sanctum of Umberlee**: The inner sanctum where [[Brinemouth Marcail]] conducts her dark rituals. The chamber is filled with water, coral, and ancient relics, creating an otherworldly and foreboding atmosphere. This is where the final battle takes place.

### **Encounters and Events**
