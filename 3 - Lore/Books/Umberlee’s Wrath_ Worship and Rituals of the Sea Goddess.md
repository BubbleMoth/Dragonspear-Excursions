> Umberlee, the Bitch Queen of the sea, is a deity feared and revered by those who make their living on the water. Her wrath is as unpredictable as the ocean itself, and her followers go to great lengths to appease her. This tome details the various rituals performed in her honor, from the simple offering of coins thrown into the sea, to the more elaborate ceremonies involving blood sacrifices. Each ritual is designed to placate Umberlee, to beg her for safe passage across the treacherous waters she controls. The book also includes prayers and hymns, passed down through generations, meant to invoke her favor or, at the very least, her indifference. The pages are worn and dog-eared, evidence of frequent use by those who know all too well the consequences of drawing Umberleeâ€™s ire.
