> The coastal regions are home to a variety of plants with remarkable medicinal properties. Among these is the Silverleaf, a plant with silvery leaves that glisten in the moonlight. It is said to be most potent when harvested at dawn, just as the sun begins to rise. The leaves can be crushed to create a salve that soothes burns and accelerates the healing of wounds. Another notable plant is the Seaflower, whose bright blue petals can be brewed into a tea that calms the nerves and eases anxiety. Coastal healers often carry bundles of these herbs, knowing that the harsh environment they live in can be as treacherous as it is beautiful. The book includes detailed illustrations and descriptions of each plant, making it an essential guide for any herbalist or healer working near the sea.
