> In the days when the sea was yet uncharted and the horizon seemed like the edge of the world, sailors would gather around the hearth to tell tales of the deep. Among these were the legends of the Leviathan, a creature so vast that its back was mistaken for an island. Ships would anchor upon it, only to be swallowed whole as the beast descended into the abyss. Other stories spoke of the Lost City of Nymor, a place where time stands still, and those who enter its waters are doomed to wander its submerged streets forever. The wrath of vengeful deities was also a common theme, with sailors offering sacrifices to appease the sea gods, lest they be pulled into the depths by their watery hands. Each tale, whether rooted in truth or spun from the imagination of a fearful mind, served as a reminder of the ocean's unfathomable power.
