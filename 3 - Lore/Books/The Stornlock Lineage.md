> The Stornlock family can trace its roots back to the earliest days of Moonwave Harbor, its history intertwined with the fortunes and misfortunes of the sea. Though they once enjoyed great wealth and influence, the family’s fortunes dwindled to the point of near insolvency, teetering on the edge of disaster. Paden Stornlock, the current head of the family, played a crucial role in turning their luck around. Unlike his ancestors, who were deeply invested in maritime trade, Paden showed little interest in the family’s fishing business as a youth, preferring instead to pursue art and painting. However, as the family’s situation grew dire, Paden stepped up and, through savvy decisions and an unexpected shift in fortune, restored the Stornlocks to their former glory. The family crest, depicting a wave crashing over a crescent moon, symbolizes their rise and fall, with Paden’s leadership marking a pivotal chapter in their storied lineage. While the Stornlocks are once again wealthy, the circumstances of their recovery remain a closely guarded family secret.
