## Excerpt from "The Wyrms of the Deep"

The legends of the great sea serpents, often referred to as Wyrms of the Deep, have persisted for centuries among seafarers and coastal dwellers. These colossal creatures are said to dwell in the darkest depths of the ocean, emerging only during great storms or when summoned by ancient, forgotten rites. One of the most famous accounts comes from the journal of Captain Idris Moor, a seasoned mariner who claimed to have encountered such a beast off the coast of the Broken Isles. His ship, the _Sea Widow_, was caught in a tempest, and as the crew struggled to maintain control, a massive shape emerged from the churning waters. Described as a serpent of unimaginable length, with scales the color of midnight and eyes like glowing embers, the creature circled the ship for what felt like an eternity. The crew, paralyzed by fear, watched as the beast eventually descended back into the depths, leaving the _Sea Widow_ to drift, battered but intact. Scholars debate the existence of these creatures, with some suggesting that the Wyrms are remnants of an ancient, pre-human age, while others argue they are nothing more than exaggerated tales born from the fear and superstition of sailors. However, the consistency of these reports, combined with the detailed descriptions found in various texts, lends some credence to the theory that such beings might indeed lurk in the unexplored regions of the ocean. The Wyrms are often associated with cataclysmic events, with many tales suggesting that their appearance is an omen of disaster. Some cultures even worship these creatures, offering sacrifices to appease them and prevent their wrath. Despite the many accounts, no physical evidence of these creatures has ever been found, leaving their existence shrouded in mystery.
