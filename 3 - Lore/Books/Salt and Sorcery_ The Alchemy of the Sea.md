Salt has long been revered for its preservative and purifying properties, but its potential as a magical ingredient is often overlooked. In the ancient texts of the coastal druids, salt is described as a conduit of oceanic power, capable of enhancing spells, warding off evil spirits, and even binding elemental forces.

To harness the full potential of salt, one must first gather it from a source connected to the sea. The best salt for magical purposes is harvested during a full moon, when the tides are at their peak and the ocean’s energy is most potent. This salt, known as Moon-Tide Salt, is prized for its ability to amplify protective wards and is often used in rituals to safeguard homes from malevolent spirits.

One common use of salt in sorcery is the creation of a *Circle of Binding*. By drawing a circle with salt on the ground and reciting the incantation provided in this tome, one can trap a spirit or lesser elemental within the circle’s confines. This practice is particularly useful when dealing with wayward entities that have become a nuisance or threat.

Another application is the infusion of salt with the essence of seaweed, creating a potent elixir known as *Ocean’s Embrace*. This potion, when properly prepared, grants the drinker temporary control over water, allowing them to summon waves, breathe underwater, or even communicate with aquatic creatures. The process of making this elixir is detailed later in this chapter, with careful attention to the precise timing and measurements required.

The properties of salt extend beyond mere spellcraft, as it also plays a crucial role in alchemical transmutations. When combined with certain minerals found along the coastline, salt can be used to create a powerful substance known as *Aqua Vitae*, which is believed to rejuvenate the body and extend life. However, the exact formula for Aqua Vitae remains a closely guarded secret among the alchemists of the coastal cities, passed down through generations.
